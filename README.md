# Run 2 sync
Synchronisation for AZh to lltautau analysis for Run 2, first we start the 2016 Sync on EEMT channel

See here for instructions how to produce sync trees: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/AZh-Htautau-Run2#Synchronization_Selection

Please create a subfolder for a given analysis team, and add txt files (and sym links if you deem them useful) containing the latest sync files for a given channel and a short description (e.g. what's missing, what changed, etc)
